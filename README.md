# Contact Parser

**Problem Statement**: I have too many contacts on my phone. Many of whom I have lost touch with. But, occasionally I get a text message from a rando and I'm like "who dis be?". Every 6 months or so I would back up my contacts. What can I do with them?

**Approach**: Python script to parse the contacts into an organized spreadsheet for easy lookup.

**Note**: For obvious reason I am excluding my .vcf files.
